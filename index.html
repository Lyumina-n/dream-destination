        <h2 >Turkish Coffee</h2>
        <p >Turkish is a must try! During the Ottoman period, women socialized with each other over coffee and sweets. Men socialized in coffee houses to discuss politics and to play backgammon (Tavla in Turkish). Today, Turkish coffee houses continue their role in society as a meeting place for both the cultured citizen and the inquisitive traveler. Turkish coffee is served hot from a special coffee pot called "cezve". The flavor is all about Turkey, not ordinary, like sand and the sea the same time. After you finish your cup turn it upside down on the saucer and let it cool for fortune reading from the coffee grounds remaining in the cup.  </p>

    <h3>
Cappadocia has been the cradle of many Anatolian civilizations throughout history and has lots of customs and traditions on its territory. However, it has blended the traditions of the Turkish people living throughout centuries in its own way. You can find many activities in Cappadocia where you can get to know the old Turkish culture such as Turkish bath culture, mystic dervish shows, Turkish melodies and live music, folk dances, tasting of Turkish cuisine.</br>
As cats are considered sacred in Islamic traditions owing to the story of a cat who protected the Prophet Muhammad from a deadly snake while he was praying, these feline creatures are pampered, loved and taken care of in Turkey.
