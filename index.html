        <p class="description-overlay">Turkish is a must try! During the Ottoman period, women socialized with each other over coffee and sweets. Men socialized in coffee houses to discuss politics and to play backgammon (Tavla in Turkish). Today, Turkish coffee houses continue their role in society as a meeting place for both the cultured citizen and the inquisitive traveler. Turkish coffee is served hot from a special coffee pot called "cezve". The flavor is all about Turkey, not ordinary, like sand and the sea the same time. After you finish your cup turn it upside down on the saucer and let it cool for fortune reading from the coffee grounds remaining in the cup.  </p>
